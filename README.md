# REPLMasteryWorkshop

This workshop will be a jam-packed, hands-on tour of the Julia REPL so that beginners and experts alike can learn a few tips and tricks. Every Julia user spends a significant amount of coding time interacting with the REPL - my claim for this workshop is that all Julia users can save themselves more than 3 hours of productive coding time over their careers should they attend this workshop, so why not invest in yourself now?

Plan (pending review) for the material that will be covered:
## Navigation -
moving around,
basic commands,
variables,
shortcuts and keyboard combinations,
cross language comparison of REPL features,
Vim Mode homework
